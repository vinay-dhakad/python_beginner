INDEXING: we can say that index is a position no. of character in the string.
index helps us to excess character.
ex:
SCHOOL_MATE
012345678910
# str = "SCHOOL_MATE"
# ch = str[0]
# print(ch)

str = "SCHOOL_MATE"
ch = str[6]
print(ch)

str = "SCHOOL_MATE"
print(str[9])

we can't change our character with the help of index.
ex:
 str = "SCHOOL_MATE"
str [4] = "@"
print(str)
TypeError: 'str' object does not support item assignment
